# Front-End Assessment

## Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to go trough my project submission. I hope that I have filled all of your requirement criteria and a little bit extra ðŸ¤–

I waned everything on the screen to have a purpose so I added some more routes and functionality to round-up and get as close to a completed produt as possible without going to overboard. I did not use any ui component libraries and wrote all of the components myself as to demonstrate my deep understanding of modern front-end frameworks and concepts.

##### Additional features implemented:

- **Central State Management**: Integrated NgRx and Signals Store for streamlined state management.
- **Mock Authentication**: Added a login page with a mock authentication store.
- **Route Guards**: Added route guards for authentication.
- **Shopping Cart**: Developed a fully functioning shopping cart feature with voucher support.
- **Additional Pages**: Included an FAQs page and a Terms and Conditions page to ensure there are no broken links in the interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Latest version for building the front-end.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **RxJS**: For reactive programming and countdown functionality.
- **Apollo GraphQL**: For GraphQL API communication.
- **Tailwind/SCSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **NgRx/Signals Store**: For state management.

## Thrid-party libraries used:

- **JS Confetti**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-confetti
- **Line Icocns**: https://lineicons.com

## Route list

- `/` - Homepage with a rotateing hero banner, popular category and product lists.
- `/browse` - Browse the product selection in a paginated interface with category filter and sorting support.
- `/products/:category_slug/:product_id/:products_slug` - View product page with add to cart and shows related product.
- `/shopping-cart` - View items currently in your shopping cart
- `/order-confirmation` - Order confirmation screen
- `-/faqs` - Frequently asked questions page
- `/terms-conditions` - Mock terms and conditions page
- `/privacy-policy` - Mock privacy policy page

## Headless CMS

I used Hygraph as my headless cms, created all of the models and needed relationships and seeded with some initial dummy data. The urs is saved in the environment files so the project should just work after an `npm install` and `ng-serve` I tested it ðŸ˜‰

Ok enough talk...
